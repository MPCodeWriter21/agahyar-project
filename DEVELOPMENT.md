Development
===========

Prerequisites
-------------

- Git
- Docker & Docker Compose

Environment Variables
---------------------

Copy ``.env.example`` to ``.env`` and adjust the values for your environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Note:** ``.env`` is git-ignored and must **not** be committed. Only
> ``.env.example`` (with placeholder values) is tracked.

> **Note:** This project uses **PostGIS** (PostgreSQL with spatial extensions)
> and is designed to run via Docker. Local (non-Docker) development is not
> supported.

> **Note:** SMS phone verification (OTP) is enabled by default.  In
> development, set ``DISABLE_SMS=True`` in your ``.env`` to skip sending
> actual SMS messages -- OTP codes will be printed to the container console
> instead.

> **Note:** Email is sent via the console backend by default.  All emails
> (e.g. password reset links) are printed to the terminal.  No SMTP server
> is needed for local development.  See [MAIL_SETUP.md](MAIL_SETUP.md) for
> production email configuration.

Docker
------

### Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

The application will be available at <http://localhost:8000>.

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is also available at
<http://localhost:8080> for database management. Select **PostgreSQL** as the
driver, enter the credentials from ``.env``, and leave the server as ``db``.

### Production

```bash
# Adjust .env for production (postgres, redis, etc.)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for full production instructions.

Running Commands Inside the Container
-------------------------------------

All development commands (migrate, tests, scripts) run inside the web container:

```bash
# Run migrations
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web uv run migrate

# Create a superuser
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web uv run create-superuser

# Run tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web uv run pytest

# Populate sample data
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web uv run scripts/populate_services.py
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web uv run scripts/populate_faq.py
```

Caching
-------

Django's caching framework is always active:

- **With Redis** (``REDIS_URL`` set): Redis is used as the cache backend.
  Sessions are also stored in the cache.
- **Without Redis** (``REDIS_URL`` unset or commented): ``LocMemCache``
  (in-memory, per-process) is used as a fallback.  This is suitable for
  local development but does not share state across workers or containers.

Template fragments use ``{% cache %}`` for expensive or rarely-changing
content (e.g. FAQ lists).  The default TTL is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
Cache keys include a version suffix so they are invalidated automatically
when the underlying data changes.

GZip compression is enabled via ``django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware``
in all environments.

Session Management
------------------

Sessions use a *sliding window* approach.  The ``SessionRefreshMiddleware``
resets the session expiry on every authenticated request, so active users
stay logged in as long as they keep using the site.  Inactive users are
logged out after ``SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`` seconds (default: 3600).

Key settings (in ``settings.py``):

- ``SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`` -- inactivity timeout in seconds (default: 3600)
- ``SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`` -- cookie expires when the browser
  closes (always ``True``)
- ``SESSION_ENGINE`` -- cache-backed when Redis is available, otherwise
  the default database backend

Profiling
---------

A per-request profiling middleware is available for diagnosing performance
bottlenecks.  It uses Python's ``cProfile`` and adds query-count headers
to every response.

### Enabling

Set the ``ENABLE_PROFILING`` environment variable:

```bash
# In .env
ENABLE_PROFILING=True
```

Recreate the container for the change to take effect (``docker compose -f
docker-compose.dev.yml up -d``

### Usage

1. Make a request to any page.
2. Check the response headers:
   - ``X-Profile-Queries``: number of SQL queries executed during the
     request.
3. To see the full cProfile report, append ``?profile=1`` to any HTML
   page URL.  A dark-themed table is appended to the page showing the
   top 50 functions sorted by cumulative time.

### Reading the report

The report shows per-function statistics:

- **ncalls**: how many times the function was called
- **tottime**: total time spent in the function (excluding sub-calls)
- **cumtime**: cumulative time including sub-calls
- **filename:lineno**: source location

Focus on functions with high ``cumtime`` -- these are the bottlenecks.

### Example

```bash
# Enable profiling
echo "ENABLE_PROFILING=True" >> .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# View profiled page
open "http://localhost:8000/service/1/?profile=1"
```

Monitoring and Logging
----------------------

### Health Check

The ``/health/`` endpoint is a lightweight health check for uptime
monitors and load balancers.  It verifies database connectivity and
returns a simple JSON response:

```json
{"status": "ok", "version": "1.2.0", "database": "ok"}
```

Returns HTTP 200 when healthy, 503 when degraded.

### Server Status (Admin Only)

The ``/admin/server-status/`` endpoint exposes detailed server resource
information.  Access is restricted to staff users.  Returns:

- ``cpu_percent`` -- current CPU usage
- ``memory_rss_mb`` -- resident memory in MB
- ``memory_percent`` -- memory usage as percentage
- ``disk_percent`` -- disk usage as percentage
- ``database`` -- database connectivity status

### Request IDs

Every request receives a unique UUID4 identifier.  The ID is:

- Returned in the ``X-Request-ID`` response header
- Included in all log entries produced during the request
- Forwarded from clients if the ``X-Request-ID`` header is already
  present in the request

### Structured Logging

Logs use a verbose format with request context:

```
2026-07-15 12:00:00 INFO [django.request] [req:abc-123] views:42 GET /faq/ 200
```

Log files are stored under ``logs/`` in the project root:

- ``logs/django.log`` -- all logs (INFO and above)
- ``logs/error.log`` -- errors only

Both files use ``RotatingFileHandler`` with a 10 MB size limit and 5
backup files.

### Sentry Error Tracking

Sentry integration is available for production error tracking.  Set the
``SENTRY_DSN`` environment variable to enable:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-key@sentry.io/project-id
```

When enabled, Sentry captures unhandled exceptions with 10% trace
sampling.  The environment tag (``development`` / ``production``) is
derived from the ``DEBUG`` setting.

Coding Conventions
------------------

- Python 3.12+ only
- Use `uv` for all Python commands (``uv run python ...``, ``uv run pytest``)
- Do not use ``python -c ...``; write a temporary script instead
- Docstrings follow reStructuredText (Sphinx) format
- Use ASCII only in source code -- avoid non-ASCII characters in .py files

Versioning
----------

The project version is defined in a single place: the ``version`` field
under ``[project]`` in ``pyproject.toml``. This is the canonical source of
truth -- do not duplicate the version string in any other file.

At runtime, the version is accessible via ``agahyar_project.__version__``,
which reads from ``importlib.metadata`` (so it always reflects the installed
package version without duplication).

Docker images receive the version at build time through a ``VERSION`` build
arg, which is set to the ``org.opencontainers.image.version`` OCI label.

To bump the version, edit only the ``version`` field in ``pyproject.toml``
and run ``uv lock`` to update the lockfile.

Release Workflow
----------------

The ``release.yml`` GitHub Actions workflow automates Docker image releases.
On every push to ``main``, it:

1. Reads the version from ``pyproject.toml``.
2. Checks if a Git tag ``v<version>`` already exists.
3. If the tag exists, the workflow exits early (already released).
4. If the tag does not exist, it builds the Docker image, pushes it to
   GHCR (``ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>``), creates the Git tag, and publishes
   a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.

The image name is derived from ``${{ github.repository }}``, so forks
automatically release images under their own GHCR namespace.

To release a new version, simply bump the version in ``pyproject.toml``,
push to ``main``, and the workflow handles the rest.

REST API
--------

A versioned REST API is available under ``/api/v1/`` for external service
consumption.  It is built with Django REST Framework and documented with
drf-spectacular (OpenAPI 3.0).

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Methods | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ``/api/v1/auth/register/`` | POST | Public | Register a new user, returns token |
| ``/api/v1/auth/login/`` | POST | Public | Login with credentials, returns token |
| ``/api/v1/auth/logout/`` | POST | Auth only | Delete auth token (logout) |
| ``/api/v1/services/`` | GET | Public | List and retrieve government services |
| ``/api/v1/centers/`` | GET | Public | List and retrieve service centers |
| ``/api/v1/faqs/`` | GET | Public | List and retrieve FAQs |
| ``/api/v1/comments/`` | GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE | Public read / Auth write (owner only for update; owner or staff for delete) | List, retrieve, create, update, soft-delete comments |
| ``/api/v1/ratings/`` | POST | Auth only | Create or update own rating (upserts by center) |
| ``/api/v1/ratings/mine/`` | GET | Auth only | Get own rating for a given center |
| ``/api/v1/ratings/<id>/`` | DELETE | Auth only (owner) | Delete own rating |
| ``/api/v1/bookmarks/`` | GET, POST, DELETE | Auth only | Manage user bookmarks |
| ``/api/v1/schema/`` | GET | Public | OpenAPI 3.0 schema (YAML) |
| ``/api/v1/docs/`` | GET | Public | Swagger UI interactive docs |
| ``/admin/stats/`` | GET | Staff only | Admin dashboard with usage statistics and charts |

### Filtering and Search

- **Services**: ``?search=...`` (name, organization, keywords),
  ``?organization=...``
- **Centers**: ``?search=...`` (name, address, city), ``?city=...``,
  ``?service=<id>``
- **FAQs**: ``?search=...`` (question, answer, category)
- **Comments**: ``?service=<id>``, ``?service_center=<id>``

### Authentication

Two authentication methods are supported:

1. **Session authentication** -- browser-based (CSRF protected)
2. **Token authentication** -- register or log in via the API
   (``POST /api/v1/auth/register/`` or ``POST /api/v1/auth/login/``)
   and send the returned token as
   ``Authorization: Token <key>``

Public read endpoints (service list, center list, FAQ list, comment list)
do not require authentication.  Write endpoints (comments, ratings,
bookmarks) require a valid session or token.  Comment update is
restricted to the author within 24 hours.  Comment deletion is
restricted to the author or staff (soft-delete).  Rating delete is
restricted to the object owner.

### Pagination

All list endpoints are paginated (20 items per page by default).  Use the
``?page=<n>`` query parameter to navigate pages.

### OpenAPI Documentation

The interactive Swagger UI is available at ``/api/v1/docs/`` in the
browser.  The raw OpenAPI 3.0 schema can be downloaded from
``/api/v1/schema/``.

Swagger UI assets (CSS, JS, favicon) are vendored and self-hosted from
``static/libs/swagger-ui/`` -- no CDN requests are made at runtime.
The download script (``scripts/vendor_static.sh`` / ``.ps1``) fetches
swagger-ui-dist 5.32.8 from jsDelivr.  See
[self-hosted-swagger-ui.md](https://github.com/MPCodeWriter21/journal/blob/master/self-hosted-swagger-ui.md)
for the reference approach.
